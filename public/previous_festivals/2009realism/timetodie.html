Despite cross-stitched samplers of home being where the heart is, home is often where the house is.  Those we love are often just the ones we love by convention.  Mamma’s  little boy, swinging from the tree branches, grows to be the distant son with the spoiled and disrespectful daughter.  In response to this, Aniela asks, “To what has my life amounted?”  Now in her 90s, Aniela is finally alone in her equally aged and weathered country house, with her most loyal listener- her dog.  The world, and the property-hungry, newly-rich neighbors, are ready for her time to come, but Aniela is ready to take time slowly and quietly.  She blurs memories and observations but reaches a conclusion.  It is most important that her house endure.  It is a keeper of memory, of time and the remnants of heart.  Each black and white still of the film acts as a preservation in its own right.  The camera captures Aniela’s age like a highly contrasted landscape.  Cinematographer Arthur Reinhart charges the simple ways with which Aniela fills her day- peeling an apple, buttering bread, binocular viewing from her window- with the emtions she experiences as she approaches her time to die.
