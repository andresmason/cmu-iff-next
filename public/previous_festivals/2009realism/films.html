It’s an elite New England boarding school, and the social stakes are high. Athletics, beauty and drugs are the currencies of the popular, and Robert is broke by these mainstream standards. His mother ignores his phone call confessions that he does not fit the school dynamic, and she suggests either a more positive attitude or medical intervention.

“It’s ‘faction’- fact and fiction,” says Norma Khouri, “it’s like the DaVinci code,” but the DaVinci code never painted the truth as Khouri did. Her friend suffered a violent death for being involved with a Christian man. The family restored honor through murder. Khouri fled Syria, wrote the book of her “true” account while in hiding and began a personal mission against honor killings. The book was an international bestseller, propelling Khouri to fame and fortune.<br/>

A journalist sits in front of the seven-time Italian Prime Minister Guilio Andreotti, and with alarming confidence, he accuses, “It’s one or the other. You’re either the most cunning criminal in the country because you never get caught, or you’re the most persecuted man in the history of Italy.” Director Paolo Sorrentino’s portrait of Giulio Andreotti (a brilliant Toni

Angie hasn’t had any breaks in life. After losing yet another job unexpectedly, she finds herself in familiar territory: down on her luck with a son to support and parents that are quick to judge. Without haste, she dons a leather ensemble over her fit figure, tucks her long, blonde hair under a helmet, straddles stilettos over a powerful motorcycle and rides to construction sites, factories and industrial

If reality TV were real, it would be Marcela. If reality TV were about the real struggles of individuals, rather than pinning five polar opposite personalities against each other, then reality TV could be Marcela. In an ambitious, made-for-TV series, director Helena Trestikova not only continued to film Marcela, but she became a fixture in Marcela’s life, tracking her

Her name, Liubov, means “love” in Russian and for this Russian woman in a rural, farming community, “love” often means tough love. It means name calling and profanities when her son can’t multiply properly. It means calling her children lazy. It means fatigue and frustration, but it means putting food on the table and a roof over her children’s heads. Her

Despite cross-stitched samplers of home being where the heart is, home is often where the house is. Those we love are often just the ones we love by convention. Mamma’s little boy, swinging from the tree branches, grows to be the distant son with the spoiled and disrespectful daughter. In response to this, Aniela asks, “To what has my life amounted?” Now in her 90s, Aniela is finally alone in her equally aged and weathered country house, with
