<br/>
 It’s an elite New England boarding school, and the social stakes are high.  Athletics, beauty and drugs are the currencies of the popular, and Robert is broke by these mainstream standards.  His mother ignores his phone call confessions that he does not fit the school dynamic, and she suggests either a more positive attitude or medical intervention.  He chooses his computer, and the video doses of reality the internet provides him.  When it becomes mandatory to choose an after school activity, Robert naturally gravitates toward the video club, and his camera eventually gravitates to a real-life tragedy. <br/>

Antonio Campos<br/></h4>
<p><font color="#000000" >

Antonio Campos, a native New Yorker, has directed more than twenty short films and documentaries and most recently a clip for The Shins’ “Sleeping Lessons.”  At twenty-one-years old, his short film Buy It Now had its world premiere at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival Cinefondation, where it won First Prize.  Campos was accepted into the Cannes Residence Program a year later, during which time he wrote the screenplay for Afterschool.  In between completing the Residence and the production of Afterschool, Campos appeared at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 with his short film The Last 15. Campos recently formed the production company Borderline Films with his NYU classmates Josh Mond and Sean Durkin.  Afterschool is his feature film debut.<br/>
<br/>
Director Antonio Campos is scheduled to appear.
