In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, she attended Beerfest, Musikfest, Celticfest... (She drank beer and ate fried food outdoors.); in Barcelona she talked of ¡Revolución! with rat-tailed gentlemen 'til sunrise over unfiltered lucky strikes; and on a typical Saturday in Williamsburg, Brooklyn she'd ride her bike to a vegan, organic, fair-trade brunch and ironically sip PBRs at a gallery opening by night.  So upon moving to Pittsburgh, she was thrilled to have the opportunity to work on the International Film Festival--certainly one of Pittsburgh's great cultural events.  And while she still needs to make it to a Steelers game, she is grateful to be a part of this incredible festival, in particular, the screenings of <I>Neukölln Unlimited</I> and <I>My Marlon and Brando</I>!
