If the gravity of a totalitarian regime seems ill fitting as the subject for a musical, <I>Yodok Stories</I> is mind 
changing.  Inspired by the theatrics of the communist parades he once filmed in North Korea, acclaimed Polish Director 
Andrzej Fidyk conceived of the idea to portray the conflict of the split nation in a musical.  North Korean defector, 
Jung Sung San took the bait, risked his life and began the intense theater-directing process of putting his painful 
memories of the Yodok concentration camp to music and dance.</font>
