<p><strong>V&iacute;t Klus&aacute;k<br />
</strong>Czech Dream </p>
<p>V&iacute;t Klus&aacute;k is a director, cinematographer and producer. With a background in photography; in 1997-98 he was the core photographer of <em>Tanecn&iacute; sez&oacute;na </em>magazine. Currently he is in his 5th year of documentary film studies at FAMU. </p>
<p>In 2001 he made the film <strong><em>Ocet </em></strong>(Jazz War With Absent Father) about his father—musician Emil Viklick&yacute;, with whom he had only communicated through signatures on child-support cheques—without his subject's participation. When the son proposed to the father that they get to know each other through a film project about him, Viklick&yacute; refused. So Klus&aacute;k put an ad in a magazine with his father's photograph, looking for a double for the film. Jan Gogola, screenwriter for Czech Television, wrote about the film: “The bold dimension of the film resonates in the shot where Klus&aacute;k ascends to the father-double's window on a cherry picker lift so as to have a regular family chat with him. The intimate starting point of the film gradually develops into a reflection on personal and public human identity.” </p>
