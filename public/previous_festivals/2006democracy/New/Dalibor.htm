<p>A member of the European Film Academy and a recipient of the City of Zagreb award, Mr. Matanic studied Film and Television directing at the Academy of Drama in Zagreb . From 1996 to 2000 he worked on many award-winning documentaries, including <em>Derby </em><em>, Bag, Good Luck, When our Music Roars </em>, the short film <em>Silence </em> and other smaller projects. His first feature film <em>The Cashier Wants to Go to the Seaside </em> (2000) earned him the award for Best New Croatian Director and was the most-attended film of the year in Croatia . It also received the award for the best directorial debut in Cottbus , Germany and opened the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York City . <em>The Drought </em>, the first of six short films about the intimate lives of girls worldwide, won the prize for Best Short Film in Croatia . It has also won many national and international awards and was shown at Quinzaine des Realisateurs in Cannes 2003. In the opinion of many critics, Matanic's <em>Fine Dead Girls </em> is the best Croatian film to appear in the last fifteen years.
