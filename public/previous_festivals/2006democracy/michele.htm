<p><strong>Michele Stephenson <br />
</strong>Faces of Change </p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p>Ms. Stephenson's Haitian and Panamanian roots and her background as filmmaker and human rights attorney lend a unique set of experiences to documentary filmmaking. She commits to presenting personal human stories that are all too often excluded from the mainstream media, a commitment evident in her work. Adding the role of educator, she has trained many human rights activists from all over the world in video production and visual storytelling. Her film credits include <em>The Keeper </em> (winner of the 1997 Black Filmmakers' Hall of Fame), <em>Play Mas </em> (Best Documentary, Maafa Film Festival 2001) and <em>Witness Video for Change </em> (Henry Hampton Award for Excellence in Media, 2000). She will introduce <em>Faces of Change </em> and lead a discussion follow the South Side Works Cinema screening on December 8, at 8:30pm. </p>
