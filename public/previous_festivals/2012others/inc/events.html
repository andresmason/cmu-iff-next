<p>Imagine that you've just been offered the job a lifetime during the prime of your youth. You receive a car, a place to live, a substantial salary, and the freedom to live out the decadent, independent lifestyle of your dreams. You naturally accept, only to enter an inescapable, borderless world that opens your mind to the true brutality of human nature. Once you realize that you've gone too far, you are forced to forever live on the run, bearing a mask wherever you go. It's the perfect storyline for a smash hit psychological thriller, but this is the chilling true story of "el sicario", a reformed hitman who became deeply embroiled in the infamous Juarez narcotrafficking trade at a young age. In this revealing and shocking documentary, El Sicario, Room 164, director Gianfranco Rosi provides an exclusive look into the mind of a killer, shooting his entire film inside the very motel room that the sicario once used to hold and torture his kidnapped victims. Even though he is masked throughout the film in order to protect his identity, the profound psychological trauma that he experienced throughout his involvement with narcotrafficking is clearly visible in his startling reenactments, gestures, and drawings. This astonishing film will provoke audiences to question the truth about the War on Drugs that continues to dominate global politics today.</p>

<p>This festival event is presented in conjunction with The Carnegie Mellon University Center for the Arts in Society.</p>

<p class="subtitle">"Through Polish Eyes" - March 22-April 15</p>

<center><img src="images/ThroughPolishEyeslogo.jpg" alt="Through Polish Eyes"></center><br><br>

<p>The University of Pittsburgh's Polish Studies Program offers its third Polish mini film festival “Through Polish Eyes”
in conjunction with the 2012 Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival: Faces of Others. “Through Polish Eyes”
highlights the recent cinematography of Poland, a country which not only boasts an impressive record of
cinematographic achievement but also hosts important festivals such as Camerimage in Bydgoszcz and the
International Documentary and Short Film Festival in Cracow.
<br>
This year “Through Polish Eyes” features three radically different recent films from Poland, all of which address and
explore, in their own way, the concept of the Other, i.e., anyone or anything different from us.</p>
<p>The <i>Suicide Room</i>, directed by Jan Komasa, contrasts the virtual, computer-generated world to the real world, fraught with generational and sexual conflict. A tour de force of computer-generated artistry, this film was selected as best of festival by the Festival Student Jury.  Friday, March 23 @ 7:30pm at McConomy Auditorium, Carnegie Mellon University Center.  Film event will feature a presentation and reception with games.</p>


<p>In <i>The Battle of Warsaw 1920</i>, a film of epic proportions directed by Jerzy Hoffman, the conflict is national/ideological/political, as the newly reborn country of Poland faces a literally existential threat in the form of an invading Soviet army in the chaotic aftermath of World War I. This blockbuster 3D film, the most expensive film Polish production ever, will be followed by short film City of Ruins, an eerily realistic computer-generated recreation of Warsaw as it looked in 1945 - almost completely leveled to the ground by Germany as one of its final acts of World War II.  <i>Sunday, March 25 @ 3pm at AMC Loews Waterfront 22.</i></p>

<p><i>With 'The Battle of Warsaw 1920', the University of Pittsburgh kicks off its Polish Studies Endowment Drive, whose aim is to ensure the preservation into the foreseeable future of the teaching of Polish language, literature, culture, and history at this region's premier educational institution.</i></p>

<p>Finally, Jerzy Skolimowski's award-winning latest film, <b>Essential Killing</b>, forces us to examine our religious/cultural prejudices as we slowly begin to take the side of the fight for survival of an Arab terrorist.  <i>Saturday, April 14 @ 7pm at McConomy Auditorium, Carnegie Mellon University Center.</i></p>

<p>"Through Polish Eyes" is sponsored by The University of Pittsburgh's Russian and East European Studies Center, Film Studies Program, Global Studies Center, Global Cinema Project, and Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures. It is also supported by the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in New York, the Kosciuszko Foundation of New York, and the Polish Falcons of America.</p><br>

<p>Black Butterflies tells the story of Ingrid Jonker (1933-1965), a celebrated South African poet who lived during the time of the Apartheid racial segregation. Shortly after the passing of her mother, Jonker moved in with her estranged father, the Minister of Censorship in South Africa. In the midst of searching for love and a true home, Jonker became a published, political writer and poet. Her father recoiled at her anti-apartheid poetry, creating a permanent strain on their relationship, but Jonker continued to write. After her death, the anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela quoted Jonker's poem "The Dead Child of Nyanga" in his first speech to the South African Parliament, labeling Jonker as one of the finest poets of South Africa.</p>
