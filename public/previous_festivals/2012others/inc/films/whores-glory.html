<p>"Taking a selective, predictably unsalacious, unerotic and humanistic approach to the vast and complex subject of prostitution, Glawogger and his high-caliber collaborators come up with a movie that will disappoint only those looking for cheap titillation -- explicit nudity is featured only in the final reel -- but will enlighten anyone seeking better to understand what is famously a universal and timeless occupation." -- The Hollywood Reporter</p>

Best Documentary | 2012 Austrian Film Awards</p>

<p><em>Whores&rsquo; Glory</em> is a cinematic triptych that explores the world of prostitution and how the globalization of one of
the world's oldest professions has impacted the uncertain lives of prostitutes in Thailand, Bangladesh, and Mexico.
In Thailand, the carefully-styled and startlingly-youthful selections are displayed before clients in a glass case
called "The Fish Tank". In Bangladesh, a multigenerational process of indenturing merchandise allows customers to
satisfy their unfulfilled desires in the obscurity of the village ghettos. And in Mexico, transactions are made within
a lawless zone where drugs, vice, and organized crime are part of the local culture. Through colorful portraits of
the lives of prostitutes and their clients, beautiful imagery, and emotional engagement, this enlightening
documentary reveals the cultural, religious, and psychological dimensions of worlds where the most intimate act
has become a commodity.</p>
