<p>&ldquo;A road trip through Iran's vast rural spaces achieves an unlikely claustrophobia in a wry black comedy &lsquo;Mourning.&rsquo;&rdquo; -- Variety</p>

<p>When dawn breaks, a deaf couple is seen furiously arguing in sign language as they discover that their young nephew, Arshia, has been abandoned by his parents in the night. A vibrant and hilarious road trip ensues against the backdrop of the brilliant green, Iranian countryside, as Kamran and Shamrareh drive Arshia back home to Tehran while employing low voices and demonstrative gestures to contemplate the boy&rsquo;s future in midst of a terrible predicament.  The aunt and uncle try not to raise concern for their seemingly unassuming nephew who rides along in the back seat, however, their language is not as private as they believe.  This poignant black comedy gradually becomes a humorous and compassionate portrait of communicational and emotional disability, and shines a light on the witty intellectualism and morose humor of Iranian culture.</p>
