<p>&ldquo;Now that my mother has developed Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, I don&rsquo;t see her dissolving, I see her appearing. I see her as an Alice in Wonderland: she is falling through time. I fall after her, discover where she is, what she is going through, what she is doing or saying.&rdquo; In her originally stylized documentary, director Adelheid Roosen paints an intimate and private portrait of her mother. Replete with tenderness and humor, <em>Mum</em> undertakes a journey into the world of a woman with an elusive and debilitating disease.</p>

<p><b>Adelheid Roosen</b> is a Dutch director, writer, teacher, and actress who has won awards for her performances in the
play <em>Waking Up Painstakingly Slowly</em>, and in the film <em>Vulnerable</em>. As a director and writer, Roosen is known for her
straightforward and sometimes controversial and taboo-breaking statements. These elements are reflected in two
of her theater productions, <em>The Veiled Monologues</em> and <em>Is.Man</em>, which reveal intimate portrayals of Muslim men
and women living in Holland and which have toured through the United States, Turkey, and France. Roosen is
currently editor-in-chief of <em>Zina Platform</em>, a means for expression for Arabian, Turkish, and Kurd artists, an advisor
and lecturer at the Amsterdam Theatre School, and a mentor at Das Arts.</p>
