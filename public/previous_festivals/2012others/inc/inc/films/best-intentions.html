<p>Alex is a young Bucharest resident who lives a comfortable life with his girlfriend in their apartment. Unexpectedly, Alex&rsquo;s mother suffers a stroke and is hospitalized at the local town hospital, and concerned for his mother&rsquo;s health, travels back home on a whim. Unsatisfied with his mother&rsquo;s situation, Alex consults both his young friends studying medicine in the city and the doctors at the local hospital. Throughout the film, Alex becomes more and more hysterical as he is forced to decide whether to keep his mother at the hospital where she is comfortable or to transfer her to a better-established hospital in the city. The film portrays a society largely distrustful of the medical system. In <em>Best Intentions</em>, what is valued is not the expertise of the professional, but the web of personal relationships.</p>
