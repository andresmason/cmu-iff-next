<p>Imagine that you've just been offered the job a lifetime during the prime of your youth. You receive a car, a place to live, a substantial salary, and the freedom to live out the decadent, independent lifestyle of your dreams. You naturally accept, only to enter an inescapable, borderless world that opens your mind to the true brutality of human nature.  Once you realize that you've gone too far, you are forced to forever live on the run, bearing a mask wherever you go. It's the perfect storyline for a smash hit psychological thriller, but this is the chilling true story of "el sicario", a reformed hitman who became deeply embroiled in the infamous Juarez narcotrafficking trade at a young age. In this revealing and shocking documentary, <em>El Sicario, Room 164</em>, director Gianfranco Rosi provides an exclusive look into the mind of a killer, shooting his entire film inside the very motel room that the sicario once used to hold and torture his kidnapped victims.  Even though he is masked throughout the film in order to protect his identity, the profound psychological trauma that he experienced throughout his involvement with narcotrafficking is clearly visible in his startling reenactments, gestures, and drawings.  This astonishing film will provoke audiences to question the truth about the War on Drugs that continues to dominate global politics today.</p>
