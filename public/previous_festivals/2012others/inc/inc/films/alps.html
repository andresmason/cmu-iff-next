<p><em>Alps</em> is a mysterious and unique organization that provides an unusual service to relatives of the recently deceased: its members will take on the role of the dearly departed in order to help people deal with the loss of their loved ones. <em>Alps</em> follows the fortunes of its employees, especially of nurse Monte Rose, who takes her work increasingly seriously. As each Alps member pursues projects by becoming the deceased daughter, dead husband, or lost lover, an unexpected web of relationships is formed and each member is forced to make life-changing decisions. Alps explores the individual struggles of its characters as they mimic the dead, and reveals the human race's often desperate desire for a part to play and a place to fit in.</p>
