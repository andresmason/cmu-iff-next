<p>Dominik is a graduating high school senior with a promising future who enjoys partying and spending time with his
friends. When he accidentally discovers his homosexual feelings, he becomes the victim of bullying and public
humiliation. In his search for love and support, he comes upon a virtual chat room, the "Suicide Room," hosted by
the enchanting, computerized Sylvia. Sensing lies and infidelity in his own family, and experiencing the cruelty of
his former friends, Dominik searches for understanding in this new virtual community while becoming increasingly
withdrawn from the outside world. Dominik’s rejection of reality, coupled with his gradual loss of connection with
his simulated world, leads to his ultimate self-destruction.</p>
