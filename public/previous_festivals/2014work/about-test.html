		<p>"To fulfill a dream, to be allowed to sweat over lonely labor, to be given the chance to create, is 
the meat and potatoes of life. The money is the gravy." –Bette Davis </p>
 
<p>The eighth edition of the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, sponsored by the Humanities Center, is dedicated to the legacy of Paul Goodman, the world-renowned filmmaker, 
psychologist, and Carnegie Mellon professor, and to his professional focus on the human challenges and achievements of diverse groups of workers worldwide. This year, Paul has been 
recognized with two major awards at the Madrid International Film Festival for his astounding 
accomplishments, including the Best Producer of Documentary Film Award for <em>Shipbreakers</em>! 
Festival audiences will have the opportunity to explore the many "Faces of Work" through Paul's 
compelling short films along with the Pittsburgh premiere screenings of new, distinctive, and 
award-winning international films and documentaries from Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Sweden, 
Romania, Turkey, Poland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, France, Egypt, Chad, Iran, India, Israel, 
Vietnam, China, Canada, and the USA. </p>
 
<p>Paul's work emphasized global awareness through his teaching and research while exploring the 
theme of work in both international and local Pittsburgh communities. This dedication 
prompted his desire to bring to light important but often overlooked aspects of work by diverse 
individuals using his favorite teaching mechanism - filmmaking. "Faces of Work" takes its 
inspiration from Paul’s vision; its international roster of films will provide a visual examination 
and interpretation of global working conditions and spaces, and the people in them. </p>
 
<p>From Polish director Andrzej Wajda's biopic of Lech Wa&#322;&#281;sa, former electrician and controversial 
President of Poland whose championing of workers' rights contributed to the fall of communism 
in eastern Europe; to Paul Goodman's depiction of the challenging assignments of ship breakers 
in India; to famed documentarian Frederick Wiseman's exploration into the inner workings of a 
publicly-funded university; to a Chinese rehab center for Internet addicts. This year's feature 
films and documentaries will engage audiences with the efforts of workers around the globe, 
and examine how their contributions to our economy both improve and challenge societies in 
countless ways. </p>
 
<p><strong>The Faces Festival</strong> is an annual celebration of international film and its potential to shine a light 
on the human faces involved in shaping our contemporary social landscape. Audiences are 
encouraged to explore the numerous complex themes of these films beyond the screenings 
themselves by participating in audience Q&amp;A sessions with directors, artists, academics, and 
professionals; by engaging with interactive performances by student artists; and by sampling 
exotic foods and international cuisine from local eateries. </p>

<p>For additional information about the festival, please visit our website, www.cmu.edu/faces, or contact the festival director, Jolanta Lion, at jola@cmu.edu.  We look forward to seeing your faces in the audience!</p>
