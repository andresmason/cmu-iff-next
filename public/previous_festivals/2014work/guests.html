		  Danuta Wa&#322;&#281;sa, the former First Lady of Poland, published her first autobiography, <em>Dreams and Secrets</em>, in 2011.  Her frank memoir, which details the struggles she experienced as her husband, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Polish Solidarity leader Lech Wa&#322;&#281;sa, rose to power, caused a stir in Poland even before its official release, and it later inspired her depiction in Andrzej Wajda's award-winning film, <em>Wa&#322;&#281;sa: Man of Hope</em> (2013).  While her husband was leading the fight to topple communism in Poland in 1989 with his Solidarity trade union movement and serving as Poland's first democratically elected president from 1990 to 1995, Danuta was fighting for her family and the loneliness and domestic grind she faced while raising their eight children.<br /><br /></div>
