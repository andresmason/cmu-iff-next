            <h3>Jolanta Lion // Film Festival Director</h3>
      			<p>After teaching Polish language, history of Polish Cinema, and scriptwriting at the renowned National Film School in Lodz and University of Lodz, Jolanta Lion came to Pittsburgh to teach Polish Language, Film and Culture at the University of Pittsburgh. Jolanta is currently the Assistant Director of the Humanities Center at CMU, Founder & Director of the annual CMU International “Faces” Film Festival, and professor of the Film Festival Course, which she created. The festival’s recent centerpieces, made possible through Jolanta’s efforts, included the former First Lady of Poland, Danuta Walesa, Director Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs), and Director Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing). Barry Paris, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Film Critic, wrote: “The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is my annual favorite, due to the excellence of the choices by its director, Jolanta Lion, who deserves an Oscar in general.” No Oscar yet. Her favorite quote about equality is by her favorite filmmaker Kieslowski: ”We understand the concept of equality, that we all want to be equal. But I think this is absolutely not true. I don’t think anybody really wants to be equal. Everybody wants to be more equal.” Lets examine it by watching this year’s films about (In)Equality. Jolanta’s favorite film this year is Spoor by Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland.</p>

            <p>Peter Geyer is a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Business and Film. He is from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania (Taylor Swift’s hometown). All his life, he’s loved film; every step in a film’s creation interests him. So when he saw the opportunity to intern with the CMU IFF, he could not turn it down. In his position as Head Student Coordinator, his creativity and professional skills are consistently challenged. Being exposed to all the unique films made him feel more love towards the art of filmmaking. And while thinking about this year’s theme, he has seen film play an even greater role in the discussion of inequality in today’s world. He finds himself thinking about and discussing film every day, which is good because he hopes to combine his love of film with his studies of business as a career. Peter’s favorite film this festival is Life and Nothing More.</p>

He decided to be a Programmer to watch and share interesting, meaningful films. And, to confuse the computer scientists in the room. John’s favorite film this year is Beauty and the Dogs, for how vividly it brings the audience to experience their story.</p>

            <p>Keval is the kid who’s famous (read: infamous) for asking all the questions in class. Graduating in May, he’s got a wide array of interests (language, vegan cooking, sustainable development, biking, hiking, photography, you name it) but he lacks a direction in life. That’s why he decided to double major (Civil Engineering and Public Policy) and double minor (French and Global Engineering). When he’s not rereading Harry Potter or having a word named after him – “to keval” is to strike up a conversation with a stranger – he’s probably learning romantic Hindi/Urdu words through song translations. He was first involved with the International Film Festival two years ago and now, after a month-long Engineering for Developing Communities summer program in Ethiopia and a semester studying abroad in Paris, he’s making his triumphant return. His favorite films this year are Mali Blues and The Doctor from India.</p>
