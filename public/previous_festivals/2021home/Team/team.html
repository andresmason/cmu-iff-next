                    After teaching Polish language, history of Polish Cinema, and scriptwriting at the renowned National Film School in Łódź and University of Łódź, Jolanta Lion came to Pittsburgh to teach Polish Language, Film and Culture at the University of Pittsburgh. In addition she created and taught courses on contemporary Polish Cinema and the Cinema of Krzysztof Kieslowski, and she founded a Polish Film Festival "Through Polish Eyes." She is currently the Assistant Director of the Humanities Center at CMU, the Founder & Director of the annual CMU International "Faces" Film Festival, and professor of the Film Festival Course, which she created. Among the festival’s recent centerpieces were appearances by the former First Lady of Poland, Danuta Walesa, Director Jonathan Demme (<i>Silence of the Lambs</i>), and Director Spike Lee (<i>Do the Right Thing</i>). Barry Paris, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Film Critic, wrote: "The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is my annual favorite, due to the excellence of the choices by its director, Jolanta Lion, who deserves an Oscar in general." No Oscar yet. This year, as if mirroring this year's festival theme "Faces of Home," the audience will be greeted by Jolanta as she watches the film together with the audience from her Home in Pittsburgh.

She loves films and joined the festival in order to be able to work with them and help make them accessible to the public. At the CMU IFF, she works as the Logistics Coordinator, helping plan all festival events in order to make the CMU IFF an amazing cinematic experience to everyone. She is very excited for this year’s festival, especially since the theme of home is something very close to her heart, being that this is the first time that she is living away from her home country.

She has fostered a love for film ever since she was young, inspired by the creativity and universality of the form. Serving as a programming intern at the 2020 CMU International Film Festival has given Brittany the opportunity to learn more about the film industry, and spread her passion for film to her community. She believes it is vitally important that cultures from all around the world are able to speak across oceans through film, and inspire positive dialogues amongst viewers. After graduation in April, Brittany hopes to explore whatever opportunity that may come her way, and looks forward to adopting a cat or dog.  Her home right now is at my parent's home, in York Pennsylvania.

Originally from Mexico City, and with a Computer Engineering background, Ximena is also passionate about many art expressions such as playing piano, photography, and films, especially, documentaries. Five years ago, she found at CMU International Film Festival a paradise on earth and became one of its biggest fans and advocates. Additionally to her current work as Sr. Business Intelligence Consultant in Pharmacy Advanced Analytics at Highmark, Ximena contributes to CMU IFF as part of the programming committee and designs surveys for each screening to understand how the festival impacts our community in their understanding of other cultures and social issues. Ximena is a strong believer in films not only as art but as a tool to raise awareness and empathy for others. She has found at CMU IFF a new way to connect with other cultures through an extraordinary selection of films around the world, a Q&A open to the public, and catering to continue sharing comments and ideas. Each CMU IFF event shows us how other people live, thinks and feels, and allows us to discover at the end of each film, we're all the same just with a different "cover".

She likes how a home can constantly change for her. Delilah plans to finish her schooling at Pitt and then apply to graduate schools. Until then, she enjoys writing, traveling to new places, and gardening her constantly growing garden.

                    Megan is a student receiving her Master’s in Entertainment Industry Management at Carnegie Mellon University. She worked as a teacher for three years and now works as the youth outreach coordinator for the CMU international film festival with hopes of bridging the gap between learning and entertainment. When reflecting on the theme “faces of home” she thinks of her experience as a dual citizen and living in France and America. She also thinks of the children she has worked with and what home meant to them, as many were homeless or undocumented immigrants. Upon graduation, she hopes to apply her knowledge and passion to children’s programming.

Although she's been interested in film and cinema since high school, she especially loves that it's so different from the things she studies in her engineering courses. Mirra joined the CMU IFF team because she wanted to be involved in a hands-on project relating to film and thought that the theme of this year's festival was incredibly relevant in today's society. Her favorite thing about the Film Festival is that the films tackle a wide range of issues, such as environmental crises and political unrest, while still highlighting what home is to people all around the world.
