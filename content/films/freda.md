## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"Geneus’ richly detailed screenplay has plenty to say about social and political ills but never wallows in misery … it is easy to form the impression that Haiti could turn its fortunes around if people of Freda’s caliber are given the opportunity to help shape its future."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">Variety</p>
</blockquote>

Special mention of the 2021 Cannes François Chalais Prize, Freda is a powerful drama that explores womanhood in Haiti amidst a backdrop of unrest, poverty, and a yearning to enact change. Freda, a university student from a Port-au-Prince neighborhood, navigates her own desires against those of her family. Caught between possibility and tradition, the status quo and the future, Freda's journey is a microcosm of the crossroads Haiti as a nation finds itself. Through its unflinching depiction of women finding a place for themselves when the odds are stacked against them, Freda wonders at what could be, rather than what already is.
