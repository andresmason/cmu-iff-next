## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"Although films about filmmaking usually have niche appeal, international specialty sales could prove fruitful since Wei offers a particularly inspired deconstruction of the solemn regional portraits which have become a staple of Chinese independent cinema."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">Screen Daily</p>
</blockquote>

Reflective, insightful, and with just enough humor to never take itself too seriously, *Ripples of Life* works to capture the chaotic essence of indie filmmaking. Told from three different perspectives, across three chapters, the film gains different insights into, and perceptions of, the movie-making process and its unique nature. Each chapter presents a distinct viewpoint which naturally complements and contrasts with the others. The first chapter centers around a local woman from the small town in which they are shooting; the second focuses on the star of the movie itself; and the final chapter presents the screenwriter’s view. Through its satire-esque style,*Ripples of Life* effectively and artistically portrays the frenzied nature of filmmaking against the background of the intertwined stories of the individuals involved.
