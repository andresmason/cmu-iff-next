## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"Taking a simple premise with all the focus and penetration of a perfectly constructed short story, the writer-director transforms the drama of a young boy dragged between villages by his abusive alcoholic father into a larger, unforced statement about toxic patriarchy, limited resources, and the silent, enduring place of women as enablers of life."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">Variety</p>
</blockquote>

P.S. Vinothraj’s first feature-length film presents a stark view of the perils faced by the victims of domestic abuse, while simultaneously casting light on the difficulties endured by communities in South India. An alcoholic, jobless, and abusive man drags his son back to the village of his wife in an attempt to get her to return to him. The film covers the journey of father and son, rife with sweat, smudge, critters, and scorching temperatures, as they travel across the barren landscape. Dramatic, tense, and uneasy energy encompasses each aspect of the film, as even the smallest day-to-day moments teem with complexity. Vinothraj encapsulates the intricacy of familial relationships and social conditions with painstaking detail, providing the viewer with an intimate look at the struggles faced by these underrepresented communities.

## About the Director

![Director headshot]($basePublicPath$/assets/films/director_headshots/image12.png)

**Vinothraj P.S.** is an Indian filmmaker who has overcome incredible odds. Born into poverty and spending his childhood working in the flower markets of Madurai, Vinothraj first realized his passion for film while watching camera operators do their work. At nineteen, he began working at a DVD shop in Chennai, and three years later he was introduced to the Tamil film industry. After working as an assistant director for A. Sargunam, he began making his own films. *Pebbles* (2021) is his feature film debut and has been unanimously chosen as India’s submission to the 94th Academy Awards.
