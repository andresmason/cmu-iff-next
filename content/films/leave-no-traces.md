## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"Suitably uncompromising… Poland's Oscar submission dramatizes a true-life national scandal — the 1983 murder of a teenage student by Communist militia — in painstaking detail."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">Variety</p>
</blockquote>

How are those with status and power able to mask the truth? Can one person stand up against a corrupt system? Jan. P. Matuszyński explores these questions and more in Poland’s official submission for the 94th annual Academy Awards, *Leave No Traces*. Based on real-life events from 1983 Poland, the film follows best friends Grzegorz and Jurek as they come face-to-face with the oppressive military rule of the state. Every tool and method of coercion and corruption is wielded against the pair, as those in power work to cover up a heinous crime and mask the reality of the situation. Director Matuszyński captures the systemic corruption and trauma that plagued Polish society of the time, using film to illuminate the vile truth that those in power worked so diligently to conceal from the public.
