## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"The result of this impossible but fully lived love story is an excellently designed, moving film with a sure impact for the general public: it is no coincidence that Deserto particular has won, among the works scheduled for the Giornate degli Autori, the spectators' prize."</p>

After his suspension from the police force, 40-year-old Daniel awaits trial while caring for an ailing father. Daniel’s new day-to-day life is gray, dreary, and mundane as he passes the time by searching for new jobs and engaging in family squabbles. An internet love affair with a woman soon blossoms and transforms Daniel’s outlook on life, until she suddenly falls off the grid. Determined to find her, Daniel drops everything and goes on a cross-country search.  An unexpected meeting—and the subsequent revelation of the truth—shifts perspectives and calls everything into question. Daniel is forced to reexamine himself and his emotions and face his true desires. Aly Muritiba’s *Private Desert* juxtaposes love and hate, the conservative with the progressive, and shows how a single occurrence can shift long-held viewpoints and bring about radical change.
