## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"Life in the trenches for the Ukrainian army is harsh. …And it’s sometimes unbearably dull, with nothing else to do but sit around, wait, get your hair cut and play Call of Duty-style video games, where the fake fantasy war can be much more fun to fight, until actual mortar fire bursts out and you may suddenly find yourself dead."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">The Hollywood Reporter</p>
</blockquote>

Perhaps more relevant now than before, this documentary portrays the Ukrainian-Russian conflict plaguing the region before it recently burst onto the international stage. Director and French journalist Loup Bureau immersed himself in the grim reality of the conflict, living for months with soldiers in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where the enemy lies just a few kilometers away. Bombs fall, sporadic gunfire is exchanged, and the soldiers continuously dig trenches in the mud-filled land. Filmed in black and white, the film initially comes across as an ode to past conflicts. Now, however, the harsh, unpleasant, and cruel images depicted in the film do not belong rather to present-day reality. Bureau captures the intricacies and difficulties of conflict, while also delving into individuals and their stories, adding an intimate and personal dimension to the bleak horrors of war.
