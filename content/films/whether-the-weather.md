## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"But this is no bleak documentary: Manatad’s feature-length debut is frequently heartbreaking yet buoyed by human absurdity, whimsy and understated humour. These touches make Whether The Weather Is Fine delicately spellbinding."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">New Musical Express</p>
</blockquote>

Following a destructive and deadly typhoon, the city and the survivors are thrown into disarray and left with scarce supplies and resources. The film centers around three individuals—a mother,  her son, and his girlfriend—as they recover from their losses. Their recovery is cut short when another storm is projected to be heading their way. As they make their way to safety, and perhaps to a new future, differing priorities emerge and threaten to disrupt their journey. Will the trio make their way in time? Or will conflicting agendas crush their chances of survival? In a captivating and artistically-shot portrayal, *Whether the Weather is Fine* juxtaposes not only the beauty of nature and its deadly powers but also the contending needs and perspectives of individuals.
