## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"This gritty vérité doc, assembled over eight years of intermittent shooting, attests to the determination and resilience of local residents enduring endemic harassment and violence, and determined to provide for their families and preserve their way of life."</p>

</blockquote>

Filmed over the course of eight years, this documentary immerses viewers in a high-speed journey, fraught with a constant balance between risk and reward. As viable work diminishes in their region, two Bedouin cousins attempt to smuggle Palestinian workers across the Negev desert to areas where labor is in high demand. The ever-looming Israeli military presence and surveillance creates a nuanced environment of fear, suspicion, and hostility for the entirety of their journey. The film portrays the motivation and determination to provide for oneself and one’s family, despite knowing the plethora of risks they will face along the way. The film casts an honest light on the treatment of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers, the apprehensive environment in which no one knows who to trust, and the basic human needs and desires driving the action. Through striking camerawork and relentless devotion to capturing the story, directors Abugeth and Carsenty display the same determination as their film’s subjects.
