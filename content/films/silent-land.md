## About the Film

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">"Her film is like poetry itself – distilled, with every word used purposefully and carefully, and indeed, her characters bring to mind the TS Eliot poem The Hollow Men. However, Silent Land is not just observational, slow cinema; it’s also a distinct and socially engaged whisper."</p>
  <p class="blockquote-footer">Cineuropa</p>
</blockquote>

Female director and screenwriter Aga Woszczyńska’s debut feature-length film follows a seemingly perfect young Polish couple on summer vacation on an Italian island. Following a tragic accident at the residence, their vacation soon unravels. Artistically subtle, tense, and deliberate, the facade of the blissful couple is slowly unraveled and torn to pieces with each scene. Through a variety of cinematic tools, Woszczyńska establishes a powerful atmosphere of looming fear, with the always-present question of what happens next. *Silent Land* depicts suppressed emotions, human frailty, and moral downfalls in a poetically portrayed debut film.
