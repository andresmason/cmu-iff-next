This year’s festival theme, Faces of Home, explores how people define home, and the actions they take when their home is in a state of instability. “Home” can be a place, a group of people, a feeling, a dwelling, a town, a city, or a country. It can be where we currently live, where we grew up, or a setting that we’re still trying to find. Home can consist of family members, friends, or fellow nationals. And although we often associate these places and groups with security and warmth, they may also invoke feelings such as anxiety and fear. Indeed, “home” is generally a mix of many of these elements, a focal point of jostling associations and desires.
