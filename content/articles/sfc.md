## About the Competition

Welcome to 2021 Carnegie Mellon International “Faces” Film Festival Student Short Film Competition!

The CMU International Film Festival’s Short Film Competition (SFC) is an annual competition that aims to gather cinematic perspectives from around the world on a current social issue or idea. Our annual competition event unites local filmmakers with professionals and with in-house audiences; all the eyes a filmmaker could ask for under one roof. The SFC invites and encourages independent local filmmakers to submit a short film of their making that presents a unique vision, and creates poignant conversation.

For more info about this year’s Short Film Competition, please download our “Guidelines” document.
