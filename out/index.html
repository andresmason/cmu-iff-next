We are ecstatic to see audiences together, experiencing film and what it has to offer as a group. Moving beyond the limitations of a virtual format is one of the most exciting parts of this year’s film festival, and hosting events at different Pittsburgh venues allows our team to engage with local businesses and cultural communities around the city. We are clear in our mission to bring both film lovers and the Pittsburgh community together to appreciate film and to foster our own cultural city life.</p></div><div class="container"><h2>About the Theme</h2><p>The theme for 2022&#x27;s CMU International Film Festival is &quot;Faces Behind the Masks.&quot; This year, we hope to challenge, inspire, and question our audiences on what it means to wear masks in our everyday lives, and what happens when we remove them.</p><a href="/faces/theme/"><button class="btn btn-light">Read more</button></a></div><div class="container"><h2>What do people have to say?</h2><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">&quot;The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is my annual favorite, due to the excellence of the choices by its director, Jolanta Lion, who deserves an Oscar in general.&quot;</p><p class="blockquote-footer">Barry Paris, <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">&quot;The CMU IFF is a full-city experience: Catch films at the university as well as various theaters across the city, while stopping along the way to sample [Pittsburgh&#x27;s] global cuisine.
