            <p><strong>Ye Kuang</strong> comes from China, and now he is currently doing his MFA degree in Filmmaking in New York Film Academy.</p>
            <p>Ye studied 3D animation and after effect technics in Soul, Korea and participated in a few TV series and Music Video Production there before he came to America.The passion for film and willing to be a director is what has brought him here to Los Angeles for further education and career development. Multicultural experience is quite unique and worth-mentioning treasure that has given him the opportunity to develop my value for my perspective in storytelling and for his life in general. He gets chance to compare different value between eastern and western culture and aesthetics of art and filmmaking. Ye finds that as an Asian mind, when you naturally think some of the aesthetics and values only work in a certain culture as in Asian, you will be surprised to find out that it actually related and connected in western culture and belief, what is different is the way people express themselves.</p>
            <p>He is especially interested in the subject matters that explore human nature such as Fight Club, Seven and The silence of Lamb as such.  Probably due to the society and cultural background that je grew up and his personal attribute, He wishes he could tell audience what he see behind certain social phenomenon and humanity through film. At the same time, He wishes he could learn from different film and to experience different life.</p>
