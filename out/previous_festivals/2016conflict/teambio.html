            <h3>Jolanta Lion // Festival Director</h3>
            <p>Whether she was negotiating with everyone she met for possible funding, arguing with volunteers whether a minivan could pass for a “car service,” or fighting the universe for more hours in the day, Jolanta often found herself in conflict as she prepared for this year’s festival. Her passion for independent filmmaking spawned a new conflict this year - Jolanta versus Smart Phones - a case to win young audiences’ attention. For the 10th Anniversary, Jolanta launched the CMU IFF Youth Outreach Program, in which middle-school and high-school students will screen films with directors featured in this year’s lineup and foster their passion for independent cinema. She also launched the Weekend Intensive course- “Faces of Conflict,” in which students will use the festival films as a starting point for film and conflict analysis. Amidst all her conflicts, Jolanta is hoping she’ll be able to sit back and enjoy her favorite film <em>The Dybbuk. A Tale of Wandering Souls</em>.</p>

            <h3>Alex Heald // Assistant Director, Logistics Coordinator</h3>
            <p>As a current Master of Entertainment Industry Management student at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University, Alex has found a way to pair his love for films and pop culture with his ability to effectively make a lot of spreadsheets. Originally hailing from Little Rock, Arkansas, with several brief sojourns in New York City and Abu Dhabi, he has loved his time in Pittsburgh and looks forward to moving to Los Angeles this summer to continue his masters program. In his downtime, Alex enjoys running, exploring new cities via their food and beer selection, and writing about himself in the third person. His favorite film of the festival is <em>Magical Girl</em> (do NOT miss it), and his favorite of all time is a dead heat between <em>Kill Bill: Vol. 1</em> and <em>Gattaca</em>.</p>

            <h3>Quelcy Kogel // Assistant Director, Creative Director</h3>
            <p>Quelcy became one of the first “faces” when she worked closely with Jolanta on many creative aspects of the inaugural film festival- Faces of Democracy in 2006. After graduating from CMU with degrees in Architecture, Spanish and International Relations, Quelcy eventually found passion for work as a freelance food stylist, food blogger (<a href="http://www.withthegrains.com" target="_blank">www.withthegrains.com</a>), interior designer, photographer and event designer. Even when she left the country for an extended period of time, Jolanta shipped her screeners for review. She returned for 10th Anniversary as a Creative Director. Her favorite films this year are <em>The Here After</em> and <em>Magical Girl</em>.

            <h3>Cynthia Tam // Assistant Director, Communications Coordinator</h3>
            <p>Cynthia has seen many faces during her time with the festival: Migration, Others, Media, and Work.  She is moved by great storytelling in all forms, whether on the page, through dialogue, in podcasts, or, in the case of the festival, on the screen.  She is currently an administrator at Einhorn Media Group.  Conflict itself is a conflicting force in Cynthia’s life that both makes her want to stay in bed under the covers and conversely inspires her to get up and engage.  She hopes you find yourself similarly moved after attending this year’s film events, especially her favorite selections: <em>Coffin in the Mountain</em>, <em>The Here After</em>, and <em>Tales</em>.</p>

When her department head suggested an internship at the CMU International Film Festival, she knew she couldn't pass up the opportunity. Jayne loves watching films of every genre. Her favorite film this season is <em>Taj Mahal</em>. </p>

Before Jewel became a Master of Entertainment Industry Management student at Carnegie Mellon, he majored in Media Studies as an undergraduate at Pomona College, where he spent most of his time exploring critical theory, Foucault, topics of intimacy, and power relations in various permutations.</p>

            <p>Julie Zhang, a native of Shanghai, China, contracted a terminal case of the movies when she saw <em>The Lion King</em> in 1995. Her current treatment includes pursuing a Master of Entertainment Industry Management degree at Carnegie Mellon University and being an aspiring writer on the side. She is notoriously bad at picking a favorite film among any category. But for this year’s festival, she would not mind watching <em>Coffin in the Mountain</em> a couple of times a day.</p>

It naturally became a ritual to go see off-beat international movies with his parents. (Kendall Square Cinema in Cambridge, MA is the secret spot). That long standing tradition is why he's apart of IFF: to help keep the amazing tradition of cinema-going alive and well. As an architecture major, Sam uses his design skills to help fuel the social media side of IFF events.</p>

He’s got a wide array of interests – debate, vegan cooking, sustainable development, glade skiing, photography, you name it – but when he matriculated (who uses that word?) in the College of Engineering at CMU, he found to his dismay that none of that helped him choose a major.  So he’s currently double majoring and double minoring; we’ll see how that goes for him.  When he’s not rereading Harry Potter or having a word named after him – “to keval” is to strike up a conversation with a random stranger – he’s involved in some facet or another of the film festival.  A student of Hindi and French, he absolutely loves languages, which is why his favorite film this year is <em>Taj Mahal</em>.</p>

            <p>Mick was born in Pittsburgh and fell in love with films during his undergraduate studies in Boston, thanks to a screening of Woody Allen’s “Love and Death.” He is currently a graduate student in the CMU School of Computer Science, and in his spare time he enjoys playing squash, discovering new films, and worrying about when the sun will burn out and what that will do to the sunscreen market.  His favorite directors include Werner Herzog, Akira Kurosawa, Luis Buñuel, and Stanley Kubrick, and his favorite film in the festival this year is Hanna Polak’s <em>“Something Better To Come.”</em></p>

            <p>Kyle is a graphic designer by trade, but most of the time, he prefers to ditch his shoes and don his other hat- that of urban farmer. In 2015, he founded Hazelwood Urban Farms and is working  to convert vacant lots in one of Pittsburgh's food deserts into an organic farm. He’s also a passionate advocate for honeybees and sits on the board of Burgh Bees. When the sun goes down, Kyle can still occasionally be found illustrating and designing. His sketch became the barbed wire faces of conflict you see on the festival materials. <a href="http://www.kylepattisondesign.com" target="_blank">www.kylepattisondesign.com</a></p>
