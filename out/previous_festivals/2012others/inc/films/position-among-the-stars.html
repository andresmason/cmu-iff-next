<p>"Engrossing, poetic and often very funny, 'Position,' like its predecessors, uses the lens of a single family to view the tumult of an entire country." -- New York Times</p>

<p>As the final segment of a trilogy, <em>Position Among the Stars</em> follows the award-winning documentaries <em>Eye of the
Day</em> and <em>Shape of the Moon</em>. <em>Position Among the Stars</em> once again follows the Sjamsuddin family as a microcosm of
the underlying patterns of life in Indonesia. Tari is more concerned about hanging out with her girlfriends, fashion,
and Jakarta’s nightlife than graduating from high school. Meanwhile, her uncle and guardian, Bakti, is busy
gambling with his Siamese fighting fish, leaving Rumidjah, his mother and Tari’s formidable grandmother, to
ceaselessly urge her granddaughter towards college in hopes of having her lead a better life. Director Leonard
Retel Helmrich uses a unique and breathtaking 'single-shot cinema' technique to capture another chapter of the
family's strive for upward advancement amidst clashing values between generations, growing differences between
the lives of the rich and the poor, and Indonesia's political instability.</p>
