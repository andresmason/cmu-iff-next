<p>Standing in an old factory in Germany with historical footage projected on either side of him, German politician Joschka Fischer recounts his extraordinary personal story literally against the backdrop of 60 years of German history.  <em>Joschka and Sir Fischer</em> presents Joschka&rsquo;s colorful biography from his revolutionary beginnings as part of Germany's rising student movement in the 1960s to his controversial command as a member of the Green Party in the 1980s to establishing himself as a fiery and outspoken leader who would captivate Germany and serve as the country's most memorable Foreign Minister from 1998-2005.  In an insightful exploration of Joschka&rsquo;s life through never-before-seen footage and in-person interviews with his contemporaries, Pepe Danquart captures the charm, wit and unparalleled wisdom of a figure whose legend helped shape the turbulent history of Post-World War II Germany.</p>
