<p>After killing a small group of American soldiers in the desert of an unnamed country, the Arab insurgent
Mohammed is apprehended and "rendered" to Europe for questioning, made impossible both by the language
barrier and by his being deafened by an explosion. In the snow-capped mountains of wintertime Poland, he
escapes from his guards and begins a journey of survival, as he must find food, obtain warm clothes, and try to stay
alive, all the while being pursued by the best that modern technology has to offer. Skolimowski's film offers an
unusual viewpoint of the "enemy." The audience watches Mohammed's struggle to survive, both unable, and
unable not to, identify with his natural, animalistic instincts innate to all humans.</p>

<p><b>Jerzy Skolimowski,</b> a Polish film director, screenwriter, playwright, and actor, was born in Lodz, Poland on May 5,
1938. He received his university degree in history, literature, and ethnology from Warsaw University in 1959, and
two years later, he completed his studies in Film Directing at Lodz Film School. Since his 1960 debut <i>The Menacing
Eye (Oko wykol)</i> Skolimowski has directed more than twenty films. In 1967, Skolimowski had to leave Poland due to
severe censoring restrictions on his politically candid <i>Hands Up! (Rece do gory)</i>. Since then, he has lived throughout
Europe and in Los Angeles. In 2008, upon his return to Poland after seventeen years, Skolimowski directed Four
<i>Nights with Anna (Cztery noce z Anna)</i>.</p>
<p>Presented in conjunction with the "Through Polish Eyes" Film Festival. Sponsored by University of Pittsburgh's
Russian and East European Studies Center, Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, and Film Studies
Program.</p>

<p>Preceding the premiere of <i>Essential Killing</i>, we will acquaint audiences with a taste of <i>Essential Pittsburgh</i>.  In the short film “Dreams of an Immigrant”, starring Pittsburgh actor and <i>Essential Pittsburgh</i> public radio host Paul Guggenheimer, an idealistic immigrant sets out to achieve the American Dream during the contemporary economic recession.  Filmed on location in Aberdeen, South Dakota during a real cold snap in the winter of 2009, director Shaun O’Connell reimagines the old style of 1950s propaganda films in a comic yet tragic reflection of communist paranoia and suspicions of immigrants.  </p>
