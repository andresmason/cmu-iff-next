<p class="title">About Faces of Others:</span>

<p><center>"The difficulty in speaking about our planet arises if for no other reason from the fact that the world looks different from each different place..."</center><center>-Ryszard Kapuscinski, Polish foreign correspondent and writer</center></p>

<p>Every year, the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival challenges its participants to view the world with an open mind and through a myriad of multicultural lenses. In 2012, the tradition continues as the selected festival films explore this year's theme: Faces of Others. The Other is something that every person on this planet experiences, but it is also something that baffles scholars, psychologists, and philosophers alike. The festival invites you to explore the concept of the Other and join the minds of numerous national cinematic traditions: Dutch, Polish, Latin American, French, Finnish, Germanic, Norwegian, African, Middle Eastern, Romanian, Hungarian, Austrian, Greek, Russian, and Chinese. </p>

    

<p>How do we define the Other? The term Other can be defined as anyone or anything that is not us. At first a seemingly simple notion, under careful consideration the term becomes more ambiguous and complex. An Other can be identified as anyone of a different culture, language, religion, gender, appearance, sexual preference, personality, world view-the list could go on. In contrast, an Other can also be something very familiar to us: our family, our desires, or even ourselves in times when our thoughts and actions do not seem to align with the person we thought we were.</p>

    

<p>In the midst of these musings, our minds begin to wonder. Is it possible to understand the Other? Is it possible, in a world full of binary relationships, to know who the Other is: the citizen or the foreigner, the parent or the child, the audience or the film? Perhaps most importantly, can the Other even exist? Or is the Other just our mind's creation used to explain that which is different from us?</p>

    

<p>We have searched the world to select unique, independent films that strike at these questions. These films cannot be seen in commercial theaters or streamed on a computer. Many are award-winning films from the Amsterdam, Cannes, Berlin, and Sundance film festivals, and some are still in festival circuit or vying for cinema's most prestigious recognitions. Each screening will be a memorable event featuring panels with renowned international directors and casts, live performances, ethnic foods, and controversial ideas that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll.</p> 


<p>Thank you for your support of international independent film.<br>

We encourage you to open your minds.</p>
