<p>&ldquo;If you dream of your brother returning, you will face a disaster.&rdquo;  This is the ominous advice that the ten-year-old Xiang must heed to after he begins seeing visions of his long deceased sibling.  Around the same time that this apparition appears, Xiang suffers from the death of his father and the unexpected return of his coldhearted mother and stepfather.  Terrified of the punishment he will endure if he voices his disturbing thoughts aloud, young Xiang reveals the haunting images that plague him in a series of artistic portraits.  In this psychological thriller with twists at every turn, the viewer is constantly questioning the true identities of each character while attempting to distinguish reality from illusion.</p>
