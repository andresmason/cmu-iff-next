<p>"Political menace stalks youthful idealism in 'Putin&rsquo;s Kiss', a portentous, rather creepy documentary that masks its lack of historical context with an atmosphere of accumulating threat." -- New York Times</p>

<p>Although Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is often depicted as being a tyrant by Westerners, to many
Russians, especially the youth, he embodies the qualities of a strong, charismatic father figure. This is the case with 
19-year-old Marsha, who once kissed Putin on the cheek to show her adoration of this 'Napoleon of the Kremlin'.
MaRsha is also the deeply involved spokeswoman for Nashi, a Russian youth organization that promotes strong
nationalistic ideals and seeks to rid Russia of its "enemies." However, as Marsha grows and begins to befriend
members of the liberal opposition, her beliefs are challenged. When well-known internet blogger Oleg Kashin (who
was famous for comparing Putin to Hitler) is brutally attacked by Nashi advocates, Marsha must decide where her
true loyalties lie.</p><br><br>

<p><strong>Lise Birk Pedersen</strong> is a Danish director who became interested in documentary filmmaking when she traveled to China by herself at the age of 16. Her first short documentary "Margarita" debuted in 2003, and Pederson followed it up with several other shorts (including 2010 short "Nastya in Love"). Putin's Kiss is Pedersen&rsquo;s first feature-length film, and it has received much attention at this year&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival.</p>
