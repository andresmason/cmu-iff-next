<p><em>Black Butterflies</em> tells the story of Ingrid Jonker (1933-1965), a celebrated South African poet who lived during the
time of the Apartheid racial segregations. Shortly after the passing of her mother, Jonker moved in with her
estranged father, the Minister of Censorship in South Africa. In the midst of searching for love and a true home,
Jonker became a published political writer and poet. Her father rebelled against her anti-apartheid poetry, creating
a permanent strain on their relationship, but Jonker continued to write. After her death, anti-apartheid activist
Nelson Mandela quoted Jonkerâ€™s poem "The Dead Child of Nyanga" in his first speech to the South African
Parliament, labeling Jonker as one of the finest poets of South Africa.</p>
