 <p>Through five video cameras, Palestinian farmer Emad Burnat captures different angles of the developing story of his village's resistance to Israeli oppression. Set in the Palestinian village of Bil'in, Emad initially records home videos of his son's early years on camera, but gradually also begins to document a resistance led by two of his best friends against a separation barrier that has been constructed in the village. As Emad's son, Abreel, grows from infant to preschooler, the peaceful acts of protests against the dividing wall start to intensify. The struggle over the barrier soon begins to impact his daily life as night raids scare Emad's family, and as he, his friends, and his brothers are either shot at or arrested. <em>5 Broken Cameras</em> depicts Emad's intensely powerful personal document of his villageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing struggle against violence and oppression, with each five of his cameras being destroyed one-by-one during the resistance.</p><br>
