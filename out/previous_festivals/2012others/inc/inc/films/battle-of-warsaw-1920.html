<p><em>The Battle of Warsaw 1920</em>the first Polish feature-length film to be entirely in 3D, reenacts the historically significant battle of the Polish-Soviet War of 1920.  The film intertwines two narrative lines: the true story of the epic defeat of the Soviet Red Army by the Polish Army and the fictional but deeply personal love story of a young actress, Ola, and a poet and cavalry officer, Jan. The film boasts skillfully-crafted sets, detailed costumes, and powerful music as it explores war, politics and, more importantly, the prices of war—personal tragedy, treachery, loss, and death.</p>
