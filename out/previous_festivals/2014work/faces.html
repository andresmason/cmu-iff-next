	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Fundraising Committee | <em>Web Junkie</em><br /><br />
	<em>I do work today to one day not have to work.</em><br /><br />
Aneury is a junior majoring in Business Administration with a specialization in Business Technology. He is fascinated by the hard labor of the working class and every spring break, he visits a rural village in Mexico to interact with the locals. Outside of class, Aneury enjoys reading and discussing future technology trends with his friends. He is grateful to have worked on the festival this year, claiming that the various films shown have broadened his perspective on the nature of work. He hopes that the audience will enjoy the program. Aneury’s favorite film this year is <em>GriGris</em>. <br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Design Committee<br /><br />
	<em>I take my work seriously, but I do not take myself seriously.</em><br /><br />
Lila is a senior undergraduate student at CMU studying Communication Design. Outside of her design studies, she loves choreographing and dancing and is the artistic director for Infra Dance Company here at CMU. In both her design and choreography, she strives to push the boundaries of conventionalism and is inspired by people like Pina Bausch and John Cage. Lila believes that rewarding success only comes from hard work, and considers personal happiness to be the epitome of one's success. She hopes that her "face of work" is always a happy and inspired one! Lila's favorite festival film is Wa&#322;&#281;sa: Man of Hope.<br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Selections Coordinator | <em>Trapped</em><br /><br />
	<em>My work is my best accessory, and I upgrade it every season.</em><br /><br />
Sara is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Literary and Cultural Studies at CMU. This is her fourth year as a student contributor to the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, and "Faces of Work" is her favorite theme yet. When she isn't decoding critical theory or planning festival events, you might find her greeting patrons at her other job at the Andy Warhol Museum. When Sara grows up, she wants to be a professor—preferably a mad one, like Professor Farnsworth. Her favorite film selections this year are <i>Sweet Dreams</i>, <i>Trapped</i>, and <i>The Cleaner</i>. <br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Logistics Coordinator | <em>GriGris</em> | <em>Sweet Dreams</em><br /><br />
	<em>I am, therefore I work.</em><br /><br />
Janae D. Green is a first-year graduate student at CMU's Heinz College studying Entertainment Industry Management. As a Chicago Native and NYC implant, Janae has lived many different lives before arriving in Pittsburgh. Her work background includes freelancing in the Film/TV industry, volunteering with local NYC community organizations, and—most importantly—traveling to her next adventure. She is excited about joining the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival committee as the Logistics Coordinator to help bring together another year of dynamic films. Janae's favorite film this year is <em>Sweet Dreams</em>.    <br /><br /> </div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">PR Coordinator | <em>The Cleaner</em> | <em>Master of the Universe</em><br /><br />
	<em>Work is that thing I do when I should be sleeping.</em><br /><br />
Ari returns to the festival this year as a junior at CMU where he majors in Business and Film Production. Outside of class, he loves to serenade the masses in his a cappella group and write scripts for future films that he will eventually get around to producing. When he is not pursuing these activities, he loves to eat cereal and cook all sorts of delectable dishes. He is also a dodgeball connoisseur. Ari's favorite festival film is <em>The Cleaner</em>. <br /><br /> </div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Selections Coordinator | <em>The Square</em><br /><br />
	<em>Caffeine is the essence of my work.</em><br /><br />
Julia is currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a double major in Film Studies and Communications and a minor in French. Please do not ask her what she plans to do after graduating, but hopefully it will involve being a "face of work" somewhere. A Brooklyn native and pop culture enthusiast, Julia claims to have the best tastes in film and music ever. In her free time, she enjoys scalding hot tea, white wine, French cinema, '70s punk and glam rock, and <i>Jeopardy</i> every weeknight at 7pm. Her favorite films this year are <em>Web Junkie</em> and <em>Trapped</em>. <br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Logistics Coordinator/Social Media Coordinator | <em>Linsanity</em><br /><br />
	<em>Work is all the effort you put in to make life better.</em><br /><br />
Miao is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Arts Management.  Along with her strong interest in visual art, Miao is also passionate about performance, film, traveling, and great food. As a Chinese student who has spent years in the United States, Miao really cares about the subject of cross-cultural communication and appreciates experiences that invite conversations between cultures. For these reasons she is very excited about joining the festival team. Miao will try her best to deliver enjoyable international experiences to all audiences! <br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit one-of-five"><img src="/faces/work14/img/students/lauralei.jpg" alt="Lauralei Kraski"></div>
	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Fundraising Committee/ShortFACES Film Competition Coordinator<br />
		 <em>Sofia's Last Ambulance</em> | <em>Wa&#322;&#281;sa: Man of Hope</em> | <em>Women's Day</em><br /><br />
	<em>When I hear the word 'work,' I react much like Sherlock would upon first stepping foot into a crime scene: Who is dying and who is just here for the coffee and donuts?</em><br /><br />
Like all college students and fellow Netflix enthusiasts, the word "work" for Lauralei is layered with good and bad connotations. As a University of Pittsburgh freshman, work can mean grinding through general education requirements and meal swipes, eagerly anticipating upperclassman-ship. As an English Writing and Film Studies major, work equates to hours upon hours of flipping through literature and film reels that have been deemed essential for survival, and hoping that one author or another will write something that basically says, "It is all worth it." As a Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival coordinator, however, work usually means organizing the ShortFACES Film Competition, assisting with general promotion outreach, and creating memorable premiere nights for the festival. This is her first year working with the festival team and hopes to eventually become a professional writer in the film and literature industries. Her favorite festival film is <em>Wa&#322;&#281;sa: Man of Hope</em>.  <br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Social Media Coordinator<br /><br />
	<em>Everything—waking up in the morning, eating, going to class—except shopping and watching films is work.</em><br /><br />
Michelle is currently a junior at CMU pursuing a double major in English &amp; Ethics and History &amp; Public Policy along with a minor in Film & Media Studies. When she isn't obsessing over 20th century musical films, sweet potatoes, and Indie magazines from Europe, Michelle watches way too many [unknown] TV shows and experiments in vegan baking. She is also a dessert connoisseur and dabbles in food photography via Instagram. <br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Chinese Component Coordinator/ShortFACES Film Competition Coordinator | <em>Linsanity</em><br /><br />
	<em>My heart is in work, and work can be really crazy here at CMU.</em><br /><br />
Peggy is currently a graduate student at CMU majoring in Entertainment Industry Management. She hates to admit that she is resistant to challenges, especially when everyone else is so proud of their ability to handle them! However, while coordinating a film festival is a lot of work, she surprisingly loves it. After all, challenges are what help people to grow and mature. In addition to the festival, she loves to do a variety of "work" such as parachuting, dancing, reading crazy novels, and volunteering in remote villages.  <br /><br /></div>
	  
	  	 <div class="unit span-grid"><h3 class="no-margin top-pad">Nicole Shero</h3><hr><br /></div>
	  <div class="unit one-of-five"><img src="/faces/work14/img/students/nicole.jpg" alt="Nicole Shero"></div>
	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Web Designer/Marketing Coordinator<br /><br />
	<em>The amount of work I have to do directly correlates with the number of cat videos I watch.</em><br /><br />
Nicole Shero's idea of a "healthy work ethic" is now unreliably skewed thanks to four years with the film festival. As a freelance arts administrator, she is no stranger to computer-based labor. At her day job, she discovers stinkbugs in heavy boxes of old medical charts. In 2013, she co-founded Hatch Arts Collective, a multi-media and performance group, where she produces theatre, short films, and community workshops. This year Nicole serves as the festival web master.<br /><br /></div>
	 <div class="unit span-grid"><h3 class="no-margin top-pad">Cynthia Tam</h3><hr><br /></div>
	  <div class="unit one-of-five"><img src="/faces/work14/img/students/cynthia.jpg" alt="Cynthia Tam"></div>
	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Marketing Coordinator | <em>Web Junkie</em><br /><br />
	<em>Survival essentials: Air, water, food, clothing, shelter, and work.</em><br /><br />
Cynthia has had her share of odd jobs and volunteer experiences over the years, and is fascinated by the seemingly endless ways for people to make their living. Her fourth year with the festival, Cynthia is excited to invite Pittsburgh communities to explore the theme of work in this year's roster of films. During the day, she is an administrator at a small design firm where she is becoming more familiar with the wonders of the Excel Spreadsheet. She can't wait until the weather gets warmer so she can take long walks and bike rides to discover the remnants and renovations of industry in her new neighborhood of South Side. Her favorite festival film is <em>Sofia's Last Ambulance</em>, and she is looking forward to bringing <em>Web Junkie</em> to Pittsburgh.<br /><br /></div>

	  <div class="unit one-of-five"><img src="/faces/work14/img/students/danning.jpg" alt="Danning 'Balance' Xu "></div>
	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Selections Coordinator | <em>Shipbreakers</em> | <em>At Berkeley</em><br /><br />
	<em>It's frozen outside in Pittsburgh. 7:15 AM. Instead of staying in my sweet bed, I choose to struggle to get up and head to school. Why? Like our CMU founder Andrew Carnegie once said – 'My heart is in the work.' A busy new day begins.</em><br /><br />
Balance grew up in China and spent her undergraduate life in Japan, during which time she watched plenty of Asian films and television dramas. Currently, as a first-year graduate student in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management Program, her interest in international film and television production and marketing keeps growing and growing! She is a big fan of director Hayao Miyazaki, especially his film <i>Spirited Away</i>. Besides school and film, she enjoys singing, playing vertical flute, and collecting postcards and stamps while travelling. Her film from the festival line-up is <em>Shipbreakers</em>. <br /><br /></div>

	   <div class="unit span-grid"><h3 class="no-margin top-pad">Gilbert Xue</h3><hr><br /></div>
	  <div class="unit one-of-five"><img src="/faces/work14/img/students/gilbert.jpg" alt="Gilbert Xue"></div>
	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Fundraising Committee  | <em>Web Junkie</em><br /><br />
	<em>Work is like the beginning of a vacation. You know generally how and what you are going to do and are excited about it, but the excitement quickly fades after a few days and you find yourself wishing that you were back home again.</em><br /><br />
Gilbert Xue is a junior majoring in Business Administration with a track in Finance and a minor in Chemistry. In addition to his academic interests, he is also very passionate about the world of medicine and healthcare. He hopes to attend medical school after the completion of his undergraduate degree from CMU. Outside of the classroom, Gilbert enjoys playing ice hockey for the Carnegie Mellon Tartans and doing medical research at Johns Hopkins Hospital. At heart, Gilbert is an avid consumer of media in the form of movies and music and he is excited to work on the festival to promote the love of film.<br /><br /> </div>
	  
	  	 <div class="unit span-grid"><h3 class="no-margin top-pad">Amanda Yuan</h3><hr><br /></div>
	  <div class="unit one-of-five"><img src="/faces/work14/img/students/amanda.jpg" alt="Amanda Yuan"></div>
	  <div class="unit four-of-five">Design Committee<br /><br />
	<em>There is work everywhere—the hidden gears in the world, the untold stories that deserve to be told.</em><br /><br />
Amanda is a senior at CMU studying creative writing and psychology. Her interest in the &quot;Faces of Work&quot; stems from a journalistic perspective. Amanda's current aspiration is to have a French bulldog by her side at all times, but until then she focuses her passions on traveling, collecting small figurines, documenting life's simple pleasures, and playing &quot;Just Dance.&quot; In the future, she plans on residing by a swimmable body of water and perfecting the art of sushi making, so that she and her loved ones can enjoy fresh sushi in the comfort of home. </div>
