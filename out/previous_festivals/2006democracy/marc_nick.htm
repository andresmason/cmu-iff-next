<p><strong>Marc and Nick Francis<br />
</strong>Black Gold </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Marc and Nick Francis are independent documentary filmmakers based in the United Kingdom . Over the past five years they have conceived, filmed, and directed a number of films dealing with timely international issues. Their films have an accessible way of telling stories about the globalized world. They started filming <em>Black Gold </em> three years ago. It is their first feature-length documentary and was supported by the Sundance Institute's Documentary Program. Addressing their motivation, the directors stated, “We were provoked to make a film about coffee after it was announced at the end of 2002 that Ethiopia was facing another famine. We wanted to urgently remind audiences that through just one cup of coffee, we are inextricably connected to the livelihoods of millions of people around the world who are struggling to survive.” Other projects have included <em>Nuke UK </em> (2002) for Channel 4 -- an observational documentary which follows a group of anti-nuclear protestors in their quest to disarm Britain's arsenal of nuclear weapons; <em>St. Dunstans </em> (2003) for ITV -- a series set in an institution that cares for blind people who have served in the UK armed forces; and <em>Hyde Park </em> (2003) -- set in a neglected inner-city part of Leeds, the film explores the social tensions in a dwindling community dwarfed by one of the UK's largest universities. </p>
