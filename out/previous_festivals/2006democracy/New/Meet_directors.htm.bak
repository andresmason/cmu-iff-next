When the son proposed to the father that they get to know each other through a film project about him, Viklick&yacute; refused. So Klus&aacute;k put an ad in a magazine with his father's photograph, looking for a double for the film. Jan Gogola, screenwriter for Czech Television, wrote about the film: &ldquo;The bold dimension of the film resonates in the shot where Klus&aacute;k ascends to the father-double's window on a cherry picker lift so as to have a regular family chat with him. The intimate starting point of the film gradually develops into a reflection on personal and public human identity.&rdquo; </p>

Addressing their motivation, the directors stated, &ldquo;We were provoked to make a film about coffee after it was announced at the end of 2002 that Ethiopia was facing another famine.
