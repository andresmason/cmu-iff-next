			<i>The Punk Syndrome</i> is a documentary about Perti Kurikka's Name Day, a punk band
			currently climbing its way to popularity in Finland. Filmed amidst practice jams, touring,
			and an upcoming album release, <i>The Punk Syndrome</i> captures the band's passion for
			honest punk music in an alternative culture of "misfits". Beneath their tough exteriors,
			we see the band members' vulnerabilities and desire for real social change. This film is a
			thrilling and graceful look at a band that shows no sign of giving up or backing down.
