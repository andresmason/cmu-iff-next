			"Abandoning every ounce of common sense and any trace of doubt, you lunge onto a stage of harrowing landscapes and veiled abysses. Your new mantra: Fight or be finished." - <I>Quake III Arena, id Software</I>
			<br><br>
			School, friends, and family do not rank high on Alexander's list of priorities. This young
			Ukrainian gamer has only one passion: <i>Quake</i>. The game's "harrowing landscapes
			and veiled abysses" shut out Alexander's chronic boredom and numb his pervasive
			dissatisfaction. Putting his skill and ambition to the test, Alexander plays his way to the
			world championship. Can a title bridge the gap between Alexander's virtual life and his real
			one? Is recognition the answer to his problems?
