“The United States is a country that has been built by immigrants, which is a reality that has been happening generation after generation happening around the world since the beginning of humankind. Some leave, others seek refuge and others simply go in search of a new life. Yet, here in <em style="color:#FFFFFF;">Immigrant Nation!: The Battle for the Dream</em>, we see another reality, where the ‘American Dream’ is not within the reach of all.” -Esaú Meléndez, Director<br><br>

Imagine that you open your door one day to find police officers standing before you and requesting to see your documentation.  This is the cataclysmic opening scene to Esau Meléndez’'s shockingly poignant documentary, featuring a single mother named Elvira Arellano and her American-born son, Saul.  Faced with the dilemma of vehemently protesting the deportation mandate or temporarily leaving her child behind so that he may continue living in America, Elvira realizes the full potential of the Latino American human rights movement. Upon witnessing the compelling scenes that feature giant street protests, heart wrenching interviews with displaced families, and the political dramas displayed on national news networks, the viewer begins to apply a human face to one of the most controversial issues of the decade.  Elvira’'s visceral story inspires thoughtful debate and progressive action in support of the ever-changing mindset regarding international migration. <br><br>

<strong>Panel information:</strong><br><br>

<strong>First Panel</strong> (at Duquesne screening): Director <strong>Esaú Meléndez</strong>; <strong>Marco Gemignani</strong>, a Duquesne University assistant professor of psychology who focuses on the psychological effects of border crossing; and <strong>Sister Suzanne Susany</strong> of the Community Justice Project, a legal organization dedicated to helping Hispanic families in the Pittsburgh area understand their legal rights.<BR><br>
<strong>Second Panel</strong> (at CMU screening): Director <strong>Esaú Meléndez</strong>; <strong>Roger Rouse</strong>, a Carnegie Mellon history professor who has conducted ethnographical studies involving border cultures and the effects of globalization on the migrant; <strong>Jennifer Gully</strong>, a Carnegie Mellon Humanities professor who specializes in translation and migration studies; and <strong>Alfonso Barquera</strong>, a paralegal specializing in immigration law and the co-director of Jovenes Sin Nombres,** a Latino youth movement based in Pittsburgh whose mission is to spread awareness of the cultural and political significance of the U.S. Latin American community.<br><br>
<em>**Jovenes Sin Nombres are also submitting a short experimental documentary film to the festival's Competitive Shorts Program. The film is guided by the creative direction of Felipe Castelblanco, a CMU visual arts graduate student, and will focus on the political aspirations surrounding the Dream Act, the evolution of the dream for the Latino migrant, and the partial enactment of dreams in everyday contexts,
in hopes of sharing their overall dream of actualizing true social equality among members of the Latino community in the United States.</em><br><BR>
