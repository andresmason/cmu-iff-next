Angie hasn’t had any breaks in life.  After losing yet another job unexpectedly, she finds herself in familiar territory:  down on her luck with a son to support and parents that are quick to judge.  Without haste, she dons a leather ensemble over her fit figure, tucks her long, blonde hair under a helmet, straddles stilettos over a powerful motorcycle and rides to construction sites, factories and industrial sectors full of men that would intimidate less feisty females.  This is Angie’s new plan to turn around her life, but as she begins to taste success, her values diminish.  People become a commodity, legality becomes a loose concept and “it’s a free world” becomes an excuse to deceitfully use people to her benefit.  This is a story about immigration. <br/>

Ken Loach<br/></h4>
<p><font color="#000000" >
After studying law at St. Peter's College, Oxford, Loach drifted into theater, performing with a touring repertory company before landing a director trainee position for the BBC.  Loach first distinguished himself in 1965, with Up the Junction, a stark and realistic portrayal of working class life in South London.  Loach’s work with producer Tony Garnett coined the classification the “Loach-Garnett” style of documentary drama, a television equivalent of “social realism” in British New Wave Cinema.  His focus was firmly rooted in political marginalization, the voiceless members of society and the real grit of life versus theatrical artifice.  Though Loach has said, "A movie isn't a political movement, a party or even an article. It's just a film. At best it can add its voice to public outrage,” his production of the "Cathy Come Home" episode of "The Wednesday Play" (1964), had such an impact that it led directly to a public outcry, challenges to Parliament and finally, changes in policy on homelessness.  Loach’s feature debut came with Poor Cow (1967), and then in 1969, with Kes, he produced what is now acclaimed as one of the finest films ever made in Britain.  Loach’s work is rooted amongst Europe’s greatest directors.  Hidden Agenda (1990) won the Special Jury Prize at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival; Riff-Raff (1991) won the Felix award for Best European Film of 1992; Raining Stones (1993) won the Cannes Special Jury Prize for 1993, and 'Land and Freedom' won the FIPRESCI International Critics Prize and the Ecumenical Jury Prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.
