<h6>
<p><font color="#000000">All School of Art degree programs incorporate a broad-based approach to artmaking, encouraging a coherent, informed understanding of personal, public, conceptual and technical issues relevant to many forms of artistic expression. Students and faculty alike pursue individual trajectories in artmaking from time-honored traditional ideas and processes to experimental ideas and processes that redefine the parameters of artmaking. Students are expected to take full advantage of the wealth of resources at the university and in the Pittsburgh community. The School of Art is a fully accredited charter member of the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).  <br/>
