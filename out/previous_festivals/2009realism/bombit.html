“Just watch. And get yo damn ass excited!” –The Village Voice<br/>
“A remarkably compact and engaging overview of the history and ideology of this urban outlaw art form.”  - The Los Angeles Times<br/>

<br/>

“It was about our names, our recognition…only a fool writes his name on a wall; we wrote to end the violence… the police are too distracted by violence and major crimes to notice us…I notice the forgotten spaces and the forgotten masses without homes…I don’t want you to paint my home, so I won’t tag yours.”  From the first cans in Philadelphia, paint sprayed across the country onto other continents, leaving walls, trains, overpasses, billboards and surfaces of all shapes, speeds and sizes in the wake of its controversial fumes.  Bomb It is the guerrilla camera footage and interviews that collage together the global images, by those drawn to heights and edges, who precariously dangle between art and rebellion, galleries and the street, life and death, for the sake of spreading a message. Bomb It was shot in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Tijuana, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Hamburg, Berlin, Cape Town, São Paulo, and Tokyo and features such “bombers” as Taki 183, Cornbread, Stay High 149, T-Kid, Cope 2, Zephyr, Revs, Os Gemeos, KET, Chino, Shepard Fairey, Revok, and Mear One. <br/>

Named one of “10 Digital Directors to Watch” by Daily Variety, Reiss’ resume has grown significantly since earning his MFA from the UCLA film school.  Before entering the world of graffiti, he produced and directed a PSA for 30 Days for A Million Voices for the US Campaign for Burma featuring actors such as Jason Schwartzman, Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, comedian Sarah Silverman and the Queen of Myspace, Tila Tequila.  Jon also teaches in the Film Directing Program at CAL Arts, where he developed and oversees the Guest Artist Workshop. He created and teaches the course “Real World Survival Skills for Independent Filmmakers” which covers the practical/business aspects of filmmaking from fundraising through distribution.  As an award-winning music video director, Reiss has directed videos for Nine Inch Nails, The Black Crowes, Danzig, Slayer, and the Kottonmouth Kings. His “Happiness in Slavery” video for Nine Inch Nails won awards at the Chicago and San Francisco film festivals and was voted Top Ten by the Village Voice Critics Poll for Best Music Video.  In 1995 the Toronto Film Festival curated a retrospective of Reiss’ music videos. Additionally, his short films have screened at festivals throughout the world including Sundance, Berlin, New Directors/New Films, Edinburgh, and Chicago.
