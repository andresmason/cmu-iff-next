<font color="#000000">Her name, Liubov, means “love” in Russian and for this Russian woman in a rural, farming community, “love” often means tough love.  It means name calling and profanities when her son can’t multiply properly.   It means calling her children lazy.  It means fatigue and frustration, but it means putting food on the table and a roof over her children’s heads.  Her story is not uncommon for a Russian female.  She had a traumatizing youth and endures hardships, but what makes this mother a modern superwoman is the shear number of children she raises and that she does it alone.  Liubov grits her teeth, bears both physical and emotional pains and earns the title of “mother” for the sake of her nine children.  Filmmakers Antoine Cattin and Pavel Kostomarov spent three years becoming part of Liubov’s family, collecting episodes of her life and discovering the threads that would sew her stories together.  The emerging narrative is born of the marriage of the raw (the collective footage) and the interpretation (the filming and the editing).

<h4>
Antoine Cattin and Pavel Kostomarov</h4>

<p><font color="#000000" >
Antoine Cattin was born in 1975. He finished his studies in History, Cinema and Russian at the University of Lausanne in 2001 after which he worked as editor of the journal Hors-Champ.  Cattin relocated to Russia to work as an assistant director to Sergey Loznitsa and has since been living in both Russia and Switzerland.  Cattin has been working independently as well as with Pavel Kostomarov, a Moscow native of the same age.  Kostomarov earned a degree as a cameraman from VGIK, the State Institute of Cinematography and also worked under Loznitsa, as a director of photography.  He resides in Moscow and St.-Petersburg.  At the 47th International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film, Cattin and Kostomarov’s film Vivre en Paix won the Silver Dove in the category of Documentary Films under 45 minutes. Together, and with Elena Hill, they founded the Swiss Association production company KINOKO to develop and promote the audio-visual work of its members. The name stems from the organization created, in the 1920s, by Russian director Dziga Vertov, meaning “the eye of cinema.”  KINOKO aims to carry its ideals and goals into the context of the new century, with new technologies, new possibilities and a closer recording of “life unawares.”
