“It’s ‘faction’- fact and fiction,” says Norma Khouri, “it’s like the DaVinci code,” but the DaVinci code never painted the truth as Khouri did.  Her friend suffered a violent death for being involved with a Christian man.  The family restored honor through murder.  Khouri fled Syria, wrote the book of her “true” account while in hiding and began a personal mission against honor killings.  The book was an international bestseller, propelling Khouri to fame and fortune.  She was a publisher’s humble and heroic ideal until 2004, when esteemed Sydney Morning Herald journalist Malcolm Knox exposed her book as a work of fiction.  Director Broinowski blurs traditional directorial bounds as much as Norma blurs the bounds between fact and fiction.  Does Broinowski observe or participate in Khouri’s publicity?  Who is the true Norma Khouri: the con or the artist?  The only reality of the film is that each truth veils forbidden lies.<br/>
