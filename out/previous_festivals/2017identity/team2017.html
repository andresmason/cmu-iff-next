            <h3>Jolanta Lion // Festival Director</h3>
			<p>After teaching Polish language, history of Polish Cinema, and scriptwriting at the renowned National Film School in Lodz and University of Lodz, Jolanta came to Pittsburgh in 1999 as a visiting Kosciuszko Foundation scholar and as a Professor of Polish Language, Film and Culture at the University of Pittsburgh. She directed the 2001 Pittsburgh Polish Film Festival entitled Through Polish Eyes, attracting over 2,500 viewers. Jolanta is currently the Assistant Director of the Humanities Center at Carnegie Mellon University, and is the Director of the annual Carnegie Mellon International “Faces” Film Festival, now in its 11th season.</p>
			<p>The festival’s recent centerpieces, made possible through Jolanta’s efforts, included the former First Lady of Poland, Danuta Walesa, Academy Award-winning Director Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs), and Oscar-nominated Director Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing). Jolanta’s dedication to the CMU IFF and its mission to bring international film and culture to Pittsburgh is the reason Barry Paris, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Film Critic, wrote: “The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is my annual favorite, due to the excellence of the choices by its director, Jolanta Lion, who deserves an Oscar in general.”  No Oscar yet.  Jolanta’s favorite film this year is I, Daniel Blake by Ken Loach.</p>

            <p>A recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, Lauralei joined the CMU IFF team for the first time as a Freshman in 2013. Four years later, she is the Assistant Director. Through her years in the CMU IFF, Lauralei has most enjoyed the opportunity to explore her new-ish home: Pittsburgh. She left her native Tennessee after graduating high school, choosing Pittsburgh for her college home and for the city’s pierogies. After the Festival ends, Lauralei intends to continue working in the nonprofit world here in Pittsburgh and hopes to eventually start her own nonprofit under the mission to connect youth with rescued animals to foster therapeutic relationships. When not on CMU campus working with students and faculty to build the annual Festival, Lauralei is an avid kayaker, loves to read, and enjoys Yanni.  Her favorite film of the festival is El Futuro Perfecto.</p>

			<p>Megan Mell is a first-year Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) student at Carnegie Mellon University, and a first-time visitor to Pittsburgh. She grew up in Minnesota, completed her undergraduate degree in marketing & PR at the University of Minnesota, and worked at an ad agency in downtown Minneapolis. (Yes, it snows a lot. No, not all Midwesterners sound like characters from Fargo.) Megan is excited to serve as the festival’s logistics coordinator and head of programming & event coordination, and help the full team bring the festival to life. The selected films teach us about global issues and cultures, which is fitting because continued education and learning about different individuals, situations and viewpoints has shaped Megan’s own identity very much. We’ll see where these learnings take her as she heads into year two of the MEIM program in LA, with plans to begin a career in production or development.  El Futuro Perfecto is her favorite film this year.</p>

            <h3>Cynthia Tam // Communications Coordinator</h3>
            <p>Cynthia is an administrator at Einhorn Media Group, a small multimedia design firm in the South Side.  One of her main roles with the festival this year is to help ensure a visual consistency in its marketing and promotional materials.  Cynthia is moved by great storytelling in all forms.  Whether on the page, through dialogue, in podcasts, or, in the case of the festival, on the screen, she is inspired by a story’s ability to expand your perspective and allow you to identify with situations that initially seemed so foreign.  In her spare time, you can probably find her reading, biking, or drinking tea.  Her favorite film this season is Disturbing the Peace.</p>

            <h3>John Apostolides  // Event Coordinator</h3>
			<p>John is thrilled to coordinate several film events this year, as part of the Programming Committee. He discovered the IFF last year as an attendee, and was immediately impressed by its ability to broaden horizons and promote dialogue. He was active in theater throughout high school and he has always appreciated international friendships, travel, and studies as a second education. At CMU, John researches genomics in the Department of Computational Biology. He previously studied neuroscience and philosophy, and so he finds the theme of identity to be especially fitting. He finds one of the most inspiring aspects of the films this year is how we are each given characteristics that make up our identity; yet we can also define our identity throughout our lives.  The Eagle Huntress is John’s favorite film in the 2017 lineup.</p>

            <p>Dan is a Junior attending the University of Pittsburgh for his Bachelors in English Writing and Political Science. He is from the Philadelphia area, however he has lived in Pittsburgh for three years now and has come to consider it home. Dan serves as the social media coordinator for the festival, managing the various social media accounts and working to network and cross promote with various content creators throughout the Pittsburgh area. He joined the festival to expand the scope of his knowledge and gain more experience in planning and marketing a large-scale event. He has had a wide range of experiences during his time in school, working as a research assistant for a clinical study, switching majors (twice), and working as a Resident Assistant, and so far working with the festival has proven just as challenging and rewarding as anything he has done in the past.  His favorite film this festival is The Eagle Huntress.</p>

Sheril plans to be a part of the festival for the rest of her college years. Outside of the festival, she enjoys watching soccer (Hala Madrid!) and learning languages. Her dream is to be fluent in 5+ languages and end up working and living in Madrid, Spain.  El Futuro Perfecto is Sheril’s favorite film of the festival.</p>

All his life, he’s loved film; every step in a film’s creation interests him. So when he saw the opportunity to intern with the CMU IFF, he could not turn it down. In his position as Head of Development, his creativity and professional skills are consistently challenged. Being exposed to all the unique films made him feel more love towards the art of filmmaking. And while thinking about this year’s theme, he has seen film play an even greater role in shaping his identity. He finds himself thinking about and discussing film every day, which is good because he hopes to combine his love of film with his studies of business as a career.  His favorite film of this year’s season is 21 x New York.</p>

Currently, she is on the programming and marketing committee, helping to plan events and using her writing skills wherever needed. One thing that has shaped her identity was growing up in New York City, which fueled her love for art and diversity.

            <h3>Kat Landry // Event &amp; Logistics Coordinator</h3>
            <p>Kat Landry is a junior stage and production manager in the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama. Her main areas of work are theatre, events, and themed entertainment. Each of these industries has given her wild challenges; whether she’s managing athletes at an Extreme Pogo World Championship in Philadelphia, or knocking down a wall of Pepsi boxes in an off-site warehouse for a Drama performance, or building a motion simulator ride in a classroom on a $0 budget… she’s always having fun. Her most recent wild challenge is the IFF. This is her first year as an event coordinator with the festival, and she could not be more pleased to be a part of it. She is consistently impressed by the dedication this team shows to shedding light on the stories of others and hopes that we are all able to inspire a little empathy in the hearts of those who visit us.</p>

She serves on the marketing committee where her focus is on the non-CMU areas of Pittsburgh. While working in this festival, Elisa has enjoyed getting to see and talk about different films from all over the world and figuring out new and creative ways to promote those films. As for what’s next, Elisa is attempting to use what she’s learned at the CMU IFF to get an internship working at the Telluride Film Festival in Telluride, CO.</p>

            <p>Lesley is a senior at Pitt double majoring in Film Studies and English Writing.  As an aspiring filmmaker, she wanted to figure out what role she would play in the entertainment industry and more importantly how she could give back. With the skills she learned after four years at Pitt, she was ready to contribute to the independent film circuit, which is why she joined CMU IFF. She is a part of the Programming committee where she helps decide which films will be used and how to present them. Her main responsibilities are: the writing elements of the festival and the program booklets design and construction. She has enjoyed working with other members of the festival, who with a diverse background have shown her different ways of looking at film. The festival has opened up her understanding of identity and the importance of your own choice. After graduation she plans to begin working right away, and hopes to one day bring a script to life whether through late-night TV or the big screen.</p>
