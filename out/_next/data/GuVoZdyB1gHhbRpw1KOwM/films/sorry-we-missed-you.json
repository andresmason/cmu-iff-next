As climate change accelerates, temperatures there are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average and land degradation, mass migration, and violent social conflict are posing mounting challenges along much of its length. The Great Green Wall is a recently launched project designed to help address these challenges by initiating and linking up tree-planting and other land-restoration efforts across the Sahel. How is the project progressing and what are its chances of eventual success? Scott’s documentary follows famed Malian musician/activist, Inna Modja, as she visits key sites along the wall’s envisaged route. Exploring pressing social issues, especially ones affecting women and children, she also composes and performs powerful songs for new album that will highlight both the need for urgent action and the shared hopes that the image of the wall promotes.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kB1qK_yBVxU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>São Paulo International Film Festival, 2019, Best Documentary</li>\n<li>ECOCUP International Green Documentary Film Festival, 2019, Best Film</li>\n<li>Belgrade International Green Culture Festival, 2019, Audience Award</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/mission/PaulGoodman.png\" alt=\"Paul Goodman at his desk\"></p>\n<p><em>Jared P.
