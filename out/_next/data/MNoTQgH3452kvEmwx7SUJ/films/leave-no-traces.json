Can one person stand up against a corrupt system? Jan. P. Matuszyński explores these questions and more in Poland’s official submission for the 94th annual Academy Awards, <em>Leave No Traces</em>. Based on real-life events from 1983 Poland, the film follows best friends Grzegorz and Jurek as they come face-to-face with the oppressive military rule of the state. Every tool and method of coercion and corruption is wielded against the pair, as those in power work to cover up a heinous crime and mask the reality of the situation. Director Matuszyński captures the systemic corruption and trauma that plagued Polish society of the time, using film to illuminate the vile truth that those in power worked so diligently to conceal from the public.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIM9FZxZ5qk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>4 Wins &#x26; 6 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Cottbus Film Festival of Young East European Cinema – Winner of Competition Feature Film</li>\n<li>Polish Film Festival – Winner of Best Feature Film, Best Production Design, and Best Feature Film</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/image6.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p>Born in 1984 in Katowice, Poland, <strong>Jan Matuszyński</strong> graduated in Film Directing from the Krzysztof Kieślowski Faculty of the Radio and Television University of Silesia in 2012.
